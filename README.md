# PoteNad

PoteNad is a small, native macOS plain-text editor inspired by classic Windows 10 Notepad. It focuses on creating and editing text files without Markdown, rich text, accounts, plugins, or built-in online services. PoteNad requires macOS 13 or newer and has no third-party application dependencies.
